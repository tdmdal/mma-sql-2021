### Prerequisite

1. Please complete the following LinkedIn Learning online course before the SQL workshop. (Note that you will need to install [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/){target="_blank"} for this online course.)

    * [Learning SQL Programming by Scott Simpson](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-sql-programming){target="_blank"} (1h 27m).
    
    LinkedIn Learning is not free anymore for UofT students. However, one of the following options can get you free access to this course.
    
    * Register a free [1-month trial account](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/subscription/products){target="_blank"} and take the course. 
    * Apply for a free Toronto Public Library card, and login LinkedIn Learning via [the library site](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?R=EDB0187){target="_blank"}. (Note that you can get Toronto Public Library's [Digital Access Card](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/using-the-library/your-library-card/){target="_blank"} without visiting a library branch.)
    * If you are a UofT graduate, you could register [here](https://my.alumni.utoronto.ca/linkedinlearning){target="_blank"} at UofT alumni site to get free access to LinkedIn Learning from 8/20/2021 to 12/15/2021.

2. During the workshop, we will practise SQL together using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/){target="_blank"}, so please make sure you have a Google account.

### Slides

* Intro to SQL ([sql_bootcamp.pdf](sql_bootcamp.pdf); updated on Sept. 7)

    Please print out page 8 of the slides (the "Northwind DB" page) so you can refer to it easily when we start hands-on exercises.

### Notebook

* SQL Intro Notebook [![](colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tdmdal/mma-sql-2021/blob/master/docs/SQL_Intro_Sqlite.ipynb)

* The full Notebook (all questions solved) in HTML format has been posted on Quercus. Itâ€™s not in notebook format so you cannot simply load it to Google Colab and hit run all. Use it as a reference and build your SQL Bootcamp Notebook on your own.

### Backup Setup

If you don't have access to Google service, below is a backup setup for the workshop.

1. Install [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/){target="_blank"}. You should already have it installed if you took the online course by Scott Simpson (see Prerequisite above).

2. Download the dataset ([northwind.sqlite3](data/northwind.sqlite3)).

3. Load the dataset in DB Browser for SQLite, and follow along using the [html version](SQL_Intro_Sqlite.html) of the notebook.

### SQL Setup for RSM8411 (MMA, Fall 2021)

You will learn more SQL in RSM8411 this fall. Instead of SQLite as we use in this workshop, RSM8411 will use PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source DBMS. Please make sure you have it installed and tested before the end of this workshop. If you encounter any problem setting it up, please let me know.

* Download and install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/){target="_blank"}. You can follow the installation guide from this PostgreSQL Tutorial site: [Windows installation](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/install-postgresql/){target="_blank"} or [MacOS installation](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/install-postgresql-macos/){target="_blank"}. Note that

    * PostgreSQL management client [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/){target="_blank"} is included in the installation.
    * You do not need to install the component "Stack Builder".
    * After the installation, you should verify that everything is installed correctly. Follow the "Verify the Installation" step in the [Windows installation guide](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/install-postgresql/){target="_blank"} or the "Load the sample database" step in the [MacOS installation guide](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/install-postgresql-macos/){target="_blank"}.

* Getting-started resources: [PostgreSQL Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/postgresql-essential-training){target="_blank"}. (To access this LinkedIn course for free, refer to information in the Prerequisite section.)
